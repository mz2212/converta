# converta

This is a gif -> video converter for the video game noita, but it should work for other games that produce gifs too (:looking: Zachtronics games) 
The name is pronounced conver-ta, like noita.

If you're viewing this on Github, it's not where development takes place, this is simply a mirror. Development actually takes place [here](https://code.myon.xyz/converta)
